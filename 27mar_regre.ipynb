    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. \n",

It addresses one of the limitations of R-squared, which tends to increase as more predictors are added to the model, even if those predictors are not truly improving the model's predictive power. Adjusted R-squared penalizes excessive use of predictors by taking into account the degrees of freedom associated with each predictor.\n",

    "3 Assessing Model Improvement: When adding new predictors to a regression model, adjusted R-squared helps to assess whether the additional predictors contribute significantly to improving the model's predictive power. If the increase in adjusted R-squared is minimal after adding a new predictor, it suggests that the new predictor might not be essential for explaining the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
